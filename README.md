## Individual Script Details

### Goodreads Copy Book Info
This script adds a "Copy Info" button to Goodreads book pages that copies book information in a format ready to be pasted into spreadsheets.

### Storygraph to Goodreads
Adds a button to a Storygraph book page that redirects to a Goodreads search query with that books author and title.

#### Output Format
The script currently copies the info with specific tab formatting (that I use for my google sheet), but you can customize it by editing the script to match your needs.
